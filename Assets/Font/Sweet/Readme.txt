Sweet Pancake
==============================

We often see calligraphy fonts with a standard style developed from the brush pen strokes. Sweet Pancake fonts come in different calligraphy styles. The usual shape has been customized to make it look more personal and special.

Sweet Pancake is available in two versions, regular and X. The second version is the development of the regular version by adding sharp corners to the stem.

To be more specific, this font also includes several swash so that you can easily mix and match unique and different typographic designs. To attach a special swash to the letter end automatically, you only need to add two / three / four hyphens (the standard ligature feature must be activated).

Sweet Pancake is suitable for logotype, invitation, poster and more. Available in OTF and TTF formats, also supports multi-language and PUA encoded.
